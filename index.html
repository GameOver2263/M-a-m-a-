Remember that time we went to Four Seasons and laughed and biked and played basketball together? What about all those times you took care of me at home alone while papa was on a business trip? Or that one time you played board games with me just to have fun with me? I love you, and you should know that. I appreciate all that you have done and all you WILL do in the future. Most importantly, I appreciate you. I appreciate your kindness, your amazing personality, your endless love and support, you hard work, literally everything. When I felt down, you were there for me. When I was happy, you were there for me. You were there for me through thick and thin. I love you mama, I always will.
